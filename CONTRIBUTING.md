## Code of Conduct

By participating in this project, you agree to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment for all contributors.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: v22.x
- **pnpm**: >= 9.6.0
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For running local services (PostgreSQL 17, MinIO, Redis)

## Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub

2. **Clone your forked repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/tutly.git
   cd tutly
   ```

3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   make setup
   ```
   
   This command will:
   - Check system prerequisites
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env` if missing
   - Install all workspace dependencies via `pnpm`
   - Set up local Docker services (PostgreSQL, MinIO for S3, Redis)
   - Initialize database schema via Prisma
   - Load initial seed data

4. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   make dev
   ```
   
   The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

### Useful Commands

The project provides several Make commands for common tasks:

- `make help` - Show all available targets and descriptions
- `make setup` - Complete local setup sequence
- `make dev` - Start the development server
- `make studio` - Open Prisma Studio for database management
- `make status` - Check status of Docker services and database connection
- `make stop` - Stop all local services
- `make clean` - Clean Docker containers and volumes

### Additional npm Scripts

- `pnpm dev` - Run all workspaces in development mode
- `pnpm dev:web` - Run only the web application
- `pnpm build` - Build all packages
- `pnpm lint` - Run ESLint on all packages
- `pnpm lint:fix` - Fix ESLint errors automatically
- `pnpm format` - Check code formatting with Prettier
- `pnpm format:fix` - Fix formatting issues
- `pnpm typecheck` - Run TypeScript type checking

## Development Workflow

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   git checkout -b fix/your-bugfix-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Test your changes** locally:
   - Run the development server and verify your changes work
   - Run linting: `pnpm lint`
   - Run type checking: `pnpm typecheck`
   - Run formatting: `pnpm format`

4. **Commit your changes** with clear and descriptive commit messages

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Open a Pull Request** against the main repository

## Code Style and Quality

This project uses several tools to maintain code quality:

### ESLint
The project uses custom ESLint configurations.

Run ESLint:
```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix  # To automatically fix issues
```

### Prettier
The project uses a shared Prettier configuration for consistent formatting.

Format your code:
```bash
pnpm format
pnpm format:fix  # To automatically format files
```

### TypeScript
The project uses shared TypeScript configurations.

Run type checking:
```bash
pnpm typecheck
```

## Commit Guidelines

- Write clear, concise commit messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Reference issues and pull requests when relevant
- Keep commits focused on a single change

## Pull Request Process

1. **Ensure your code follows the project's code style** by running:
   ```bash
   pnpm lint:fix
   pnpm format:fix
   pnpm typecheck
   ```

2. **Update documentation** if you're adding new features or changing behavior

3. **Provide a clear PR description** that includes:
   - What changes you made
   - Why you made them
   - Any relevant issue numbers
   - Screenshots (if applicable for UI changes)

4. **Ensure your PR**:
   - Passes all checks
   - Doesn't introduce breaking changes (or clearly documents them)
   - Has been tested locally

5. **Be responsive** to feedback and make requested changes promptly
